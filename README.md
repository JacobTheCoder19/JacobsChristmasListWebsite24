<h2><em>✨ Purpose / Inspiration ✨</em></h2>
&emsp;This project's inspiration came from me thinking it would be funny to have a website all just for what I wanted for christmas. This website was intended just for my family which is why I didn't bother to make the desktop and tablet viewports since they were never going to open the website on those devices. This project was also a very fun learning experience on how to make music play on the website as well as the flashing red and green background.

<h2><em>⚙️ How It Works ⚙️</em></h2>
&emsp;The Christmas list website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring that users can easily navigate and interact with the content on their smartphones.

&emsp;The main feature of the website is the interactive gift display, where users can click on present images to reveal links to purchase the gifts. The background audio adds to the festive atmosphere, creating an enjoyable browsing experience.

&emsp;While the mobile version is fully functional, the desktop and tablet views are still in progress. Additional styling and layout adjustments are needed to ensure a seamless experience across all devices.
